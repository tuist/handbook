# Third-party risk management policy

## Purpose

To ensure protection of the organization's data and assets that are shared with, accessible to, or managed by suppliers,
including external parties or third-party organizations such as service providers, vendors, and customers, and to maintain
an agreed level of information security and service delivery in line with supplier agreements.

This document outlines a baseline of security controls that Tuist GmbH expects partners and other third-party companies to
meet when interacting with Tuist GmbH Confidential data.

## Scope

All data and information systems owned or used by Tuist GmbH that are business critical and/or process, store, or transmit
Confidential data. This policy applies to all employees of Tuist GmbH and to all external parties, including but not limited to
Tuist GmbH consultants, contractors, business partners, vendors, suppliers, partners, outsourced service providers, and
other third-party entities with access to Tuist GmbH data, systems, networks, or system resources.

## Generral requirements

Information security requirements for mitigating the risks associated with supplier's access to the organization's assets shall
be agreed with the supplier and documented.

For all service providers who may access Tuist GmbH Confidential data, systems, or networks, proper due diligence shall
be performed prior to provisioning access or engaging in processing activities. Information shall be maintained regarding
which regulatory or certification requirements are managed by or impacted by each service provider, and which are
managed by Tuist GmbH as required. Applicable regulatory or certification requirements may include ISO 27001, SOC 2,
PCI DSS, CCPA, GDPR or other frameworks, compliance standards, or regulations.

## Addressing security in agreements

Relevant information security requirements shall be established and agreed upon with each supplier that may access,
process, store, transmit, or impact the security of Confidential data and systems, or provide physical or virtual IT
infrastructure components for Tuist GmbH.

For all service providers who may access Tuist GmbH production systems, or who may impact the security of the Tuist
GmbH production environment, written agreements shall be maintained that include the service provider's acknowledgment
of their responsibilities for the confidentiality of company and customer data, and any commitments regarding the integrity,
availability, and/or privacy controls that they manage in order to meet the standards and requirements that Tuist GmbH has
established in accordance with Tuist GmbH's information security program or any relevant framework.

## Technology supply chain

Tuist GmbH will consider and assess risk associated with suppliers and the technology supply chain. Where warranted,
agreements with suppliers shall include requirements to address the relevant information security risks associated with
information and communications technology services and the product supply chain.

## Monitoring & review of third-party services

Tuist GmbH shall regularly monitor, review, and audit supplier service delivery. Supplier security and service delivery
performance shall be reviewed at least annually.

## Management of changes to third-party services

Changes to the provision of services by suppliers, including changes to agreements, services, technology, policies,
procedures, or controls, shall be managed, taking account of the criticality of the business information, systems, and
processes involved. Tuist GmbH shall assess the risk of any material changes made by suppliers and make appropriate
modifications to agreements and services accordingly.

## Third-party risk management

Tuist GmbH will ensure that potential risks posed by sharing Confidential data or providing access to company systems are
identified, documented and addressed according to this policy. Risk management plays an integral part in the governance
and management of the organization at a strategic and operational level. The purpose of a partner and third-party security
policy is to ensure that partnerships and services achieve their business plan aims and objectives, and are consistent with
Tuist GmbH's requirements for information security.

Tuist GmbH shall not share or transmit Confidential data to a third-party without first performing a third-party risk
assessment and fully executing a written contract, statement of work or service agreement which describes expected
service levels and any specific information security requirements.

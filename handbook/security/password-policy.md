# Password policy

At Tuist, protecting our systems and data is a top priority. To ensure security, all employees must adhere to the following password requirements:

## Password Requirements:

- **Minimum Length:** Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.
- **Complexity:** Passwords must include at least three of the following:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.)
- **Avoid Common Passwords:** Do not use easily guessable passwords (e.g., "password," "123456," names, or birthdays).
- **Unique Passwords:** Each account must have a unique password. Never reuse passwords across different services or accounts.

## Password Storage

- **Use of Password Managers:** Employees are required to use [1Password](https://1password.com) for storing and generating passwords securely.
- **No Written or Shared Passwords:** Passwords must never be written down or shared. If you need to grant access, use secure methods (e.g., temporary access management tools).

## Password Updates

- **Regular Updates:** Passwords should be updated every 90 days, or immediately if a potential breach is suspected.
- **Compromised Passwords:** If a password is suspected to be compromised, it must be changed immediately and reported to the CISO.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Mandatory MFA:** All employees must enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible for added security, particularly for sensitive systems (e.g., email, project management tools, cloud storage).

## Monitoring and Compliance

- **Random Audits:** The CIO will perform periodic audits to ensure compliance with the password policy.
- **Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with the password policy may result in disciplinary action.

## Reporting Security Incidents

If you suspect any suspicious activity, security breaches, or compromised passwords, report it immediately to the CIO or CISO.

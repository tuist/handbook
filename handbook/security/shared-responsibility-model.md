# Shared responsibility model

At Tuist, we rely on trusted infrastructure providers, such as [Fly.io](https://fly.io) and [Tigris](https://tigrisdata.com), to manage key aspects of our infrastructure security. These partnerships enable us to deliver reliable and secure services while focusing on application and data-level security.

This document outlines the shared responsibility model between Tuist and its infrastructure providers, detailing the security areas managed by each party.

## Fly.io: Security Responsibilities

[Fly.io](https://fly.io) ensures the security of its platform through the following mechanisms:

### **Fly.io's Responsibilities:**
1. **Data Center Security**
   - Physical access control, environmental safeguards, and compliance with industry standards (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).
2. **Network Security**
   - Firewall protection, DDoS mitigation, and secure routing of traffic across their global network.
3. **Platform Updates and Patch Management**
   - Continuous monitoring and patching of vulnerabilities in the Fly.io platform and underlying infrastructure.
4. **Application Security (AppSec)**
   - Secure isolation of customer workloads to prevent unauthorized access between applications running on their platform.

For more details, refer to Fly.io's [Shared Responsibility Model](https://fly.io/docs/security/shared-responsibility/) and [Application Security](https://fly.io/docs/security/security-at-fly-io/#application-security-appsec).

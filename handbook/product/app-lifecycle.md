# App lifecycle

At Tuist, we believe every app begins with a spark of inspiration. It's an itch to scratch, a problem to solve, or a vision to bring to life. These ideas are brimming with energy, and our developers harness this energy to create something innovative and impactful. For this creative process to thrive, developers need the right knowledge and tools. **Any distraction or friction can cause this energy to dissipate, resulting in missed opportunities and less impactful creations.**

We are committed to ensuring the app lifecycle is a joyful journeyâ€”free of distractions and complexities. It should feel like a harmonious dance between developers and their tools. However, the reality is often different. The app lifecycle can be a bumpy road. Soon after starting a new project, developers may spend days figuring out how to sign the app for distribution. Adding a few dependencies can significantly worsen the feedback loop, and modularizing the codebase may introduce unforeseen maintenance burdens.

This isn't fun, and it certainly isn't how we envision the development process. At Tuist, we aim to transform these challenges into a seamless and enjoyable experience. Our mission is to make the app lifecycle a smooth, uninterrupted journey, allowing developers to focus on what they do best: creating impactful and innovative applications.

To better understand how Tuist achieves this, it's important to understand the phases of the app lifecycle. Let's explore each phase in detail.

## Create

Creation is the process of starting a new project.
It's a unique moment because it's when developers' ideas begin to take shape. 
Apple has done a great job at minimizing the time to hello world in Xcode, but there's still room for improvement:

- **Templates are too barebones.** Functionality that's common across most apps, such as networking, logging, and analytics, is missing. 
-
